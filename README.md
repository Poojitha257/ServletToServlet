We can call the servlet from another servlet by using RequestDispatcher, SendRedirect, Session management and by using cookies;



1️⃣ Send Redirect:
👉 Redirects the client to a new URL.
🌐 Browser URL changes.
🔄 Creates a new request.
💡 Use for external navigation or redirecting to another application.

2️⃣ Request Dispatcher:
👉 Forwards the request internally within the same app.
🔗 Browser URL remains the same.
♻ Shares the same request scope.
💡 Use for internal resource sharing like forwarding to JSPs or other servlets.

3️⃣ Session Management:
👉 Maintains user data across multiple requests.
🔐 Data persists in session scope.
💡 Ideal for login sessions, shopping carts, etc.

4️⃣ Cookies:
👉 Store small pieces of data on the client-side. 🍪
🌐 Data persists across requests and browser sessions (depending on cookie type).
♻ Shares information between servlets via the client's browser.
💡 Ideal for tracking user preferences or maintaining session information when the session object is not suitable.
