We can call the servlet from another servlet by using RequestDispatcher and SendRedirect and even we can use Session management;



1️⃣ Send Redirect:
👉 Redirects the client to a new URL.
🌐 Browser URL changes.
🔄 Creates a new request.
💡 Use for external navigation or redirecting to another application.

2️⃣ Request Dispatcher:
👉 Forwards the request internally within the same app.
🔗 Browser URL remains the same.
♻ Shares the same request scope.
💡 Use for internal resource sharing like forwarding to JSPs or other servlets.

3️⃣ Session Management:
👉 Maintains user data across multiple requests.
🔐 Data persists in session scope.
💡 Ideal for login sessions, shopping carts, etc.
